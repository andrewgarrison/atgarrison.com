# About Me

I'm currently a Full-Time Front End Engineer at <a href="https://www.wearespreetail.com/" title="Spreetail">Spreetail</a>. I love everything UX and Front End Development related and have an interest in marketing - which is what I studied in school. When I'm not at work, I enjoy traveling, making music, and dabbling in photography/videography. 


# My Workspace

![Workspace](/img/workspace.jpg "Andrew's Desk and Computer")

This is where I hide away to work on new creative projects and watch the usual Netflix show.
