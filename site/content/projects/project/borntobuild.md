### Overview 
As a 2nd-year college intern at Gallup, I took on the responsibility of leading the development effort of Gallup's Born To Build marketing site. 

### Challenges
The biggest challenge (technologically) with this site was the text rotator that is featured on the homepage. It involves multiple animation steps and is built out using 100% CSS. I found that animations have their own gimmicks and flaws in each browser, regardless if <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN web docs</a> or <a href="//caniuse.com/">Can I Use</a> lists those specific features as being compatible in multiple browsers.

### What I Learned
Hitting on that last point, I learned in depth about CSS animations. And most importantly, I learned that strong communication between content strategists and designers is crucial to delivering a site of this scale and importance on time.

### Tools & Technology Used
CSS (LESS), HTML
