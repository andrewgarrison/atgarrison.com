### Overview 
As a 2nd-year college intern at Gallup, I took on the responsibility of leading the development effort of Gallup's Born To Build marketing site. 

### Challenges
I found my biggest development challenge with this site to be the text rotator featured on the homepage. It involves multiple animation steps and is built out using 100% CSS. Many failed attempts and a few IE & iOS Safari bug fixes later, the animation runs stable in all modern browsers.

### What I Learned
Hitting on my last point, I learned in depth about CSS animations. Furthermore, I learned that strong communication between content strategists and designers is crucial to delivering a site of this scale and importance on time.

### Tools & Technology Used
CSS (LESS), HTML
