### Overview
MovieFinder is a tool that helps people quickly search for movies and get back reliable and concise information about them.

### Challenges
This was one of the first few projects that I've used React for, so it took some time to learn how to think in React in order to craft a proper application. However, once I got a grasp of the various lifecycle methods, props, and states, I can say I have fallen in love with this library.

### What I Learned
React router, lifecycle methods, props, states, etc... 

### Tools & Technology Used
JavaScript (React), CSS (LESS), OMDb & TMDb API's, Adobe XD
