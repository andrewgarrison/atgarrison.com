### Overview
Owenmowingelkhorn.com is a business website providing information about the locally and family owned business, Owen's Mowing. 

### Challenges
I was given no real structure or information when needing to complete this website. I was only told it must be done quick and they must have the ability to edit information really easily once it was created. Because of this, I had to put myself into the shoes of them and their clients and create a website that mirrored the values and vision/mission of the business.

### What I Learned / My Experience
Quickly creating Wordpress websites, theme editing, copywriting, and working under tight deadlines

### Tools & Technology Used
Wordpress, CSS, Adobe XD
