For someone who has never invested in the stock market before it can seem very difficult to begin. Whether it's the daunting task of finding a financial adviser or not knowing where to even begin when choosing which stocks to buy, the whole process seems out of reach. How do I know this? Because I was in this exact position with those exact thoughts just a few years ago.

Thankfully, new technology has made it increasingly simple for people to start investing on their own without having to seek out help from a financial expert. Specifically, the innovative investment investment app, <a href="//acorns.com/invite/T9A7J3">Acorns</a>, allowed me to start investing affordably, quickly, and pain-free. Acorns is a leader in creating a highly usable and enriching experience with the stock market. Along with their easy and intuitive platform, they provide users with personalized investment portfolios built with the help of Nobel Prize-winning economist, Dr. Harry Markowitz. This means someone without adequate knowledge in the stock market does not have to choose a single stock or bond to invest in themselves -- the pros have already done it for them. 

### Pricing

Acorns is 100% free for all students to use and otherwise costs just $1 a month for general users. When your account soars past the $5000 mark, the fee schedule then changes to a flat rate 0.25% per year. So if you have a portfolio balance of say $25,000, you are only paying $62.50 per year directly to Acorns. Not to mention, if you're getting an average 5% return on your investment per year, you would be earning $1,250 in interest which makes the $62.50 seem very miniscule.

### How To Become a Millionaire with $5 a Day

So how can you actually build your portfolio up $25,000 or heck, $1 Million? It's actually simpler than you might think. Here's how:

1. Choose an Acorns portfolio with roughly 50% stocks and 50% bonds. In the past 100 years, blue chip stocks have paid an average 10% of interest while investment bonds have paid 6%. This averages out to be 8% - the golden interest rate that makes this possible.

2. Utilize Acorns' recurring investments and spare change round ups to fund your portfolio with $5 a day. Recurring investments allow you to set up daily automatic deposits of $5 into your account so you will never forget to fund your portfolio each day.

3. Do this for 40 - 50 years and you will have a portfolio worth over $1 Million.
