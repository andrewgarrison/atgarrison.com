Gone are the days where it seemed nearly impossible to get your hands in the stock market and start investing. Whether it was the daunting task of finding a financial advisor or being too uneducated to choose stocks on your own, the process just felt like too much work.

Luckily, technology has made it increasingly simple to start investing on your own without having to seek out help from a financial expert. Specifically, the innovative investment investment app, <a href="//www.acorns.com/">Acorns</a>, has come to save the day. Along with their easy and intuitive platform, they provide users with personalized investment portfolios built with the help of Nobel Prize-winning economist, Dr. Harry Markowitz. This means you don't have to choose a single stock or bond to invest in -- the pros do it for you. 

### Pricing

Acorns is 100% free for all students to use and otherwise costs just $1 a month for general users. When your account soars past the $5000 mark, the fee schedule then changes to a flat rate 0.25% per year. So if you have a portfolio balance of say $25,000, you are only paying $62.50 per year directly to Acorns. Not to mention, if you're getting an average 5% return on your investment per year, you would be earning $1,250 in interest which makes the $62.50 seem very miniscule.

### How To Become a Millionaire with $5 a Day

So how can you actually build your portfolio up $25,000 or heck, $1 Million? It's actually simpler than you might think. Here's how:

1. Choose an Acorns portfolio with roughly 50% stocks and 50% bonds. In the past 100 years, blue chip stocks have paid an average 10% of interest while investment bonds have paid 6%. This averages out to be 8% - the golden interest rate that makes this possible.  
2. Utilize Acorns' recurring investments and spare change round ups to fund your portfolio with $5 a day. Recurring investments allow you to set up daily automatic deposits of $5 into your account so you will never forget to fund your portfolio each day.
3. Do this for 40 - 50 years and you will have a portfolio worth over $1 Million.
