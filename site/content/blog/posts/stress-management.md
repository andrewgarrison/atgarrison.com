## Physical Fitness
Working out is most commonly correlated with a good looking phsyique, however, regular exercise can do much more than that for an individual. Specifically, working out, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), is critical for maintaining mental toughness and reducing stress. In particular, "exercise and other physical activity produce endorphins—chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers—and also improve the ability to sleep, which in turn reduces stress" (ADAA, Physical Activity Reduces Stress). As stated, working out rids the brain of stress in two ways: by producing endorphins and making individuals more tired which increase their chances of a better night sleep. I recommend working out at least for 15 - 30 minutes each day. This could consist of going on a 10 minute jog and following it up with an ab exercise or going to the HPER and lifting weights or playing a pickup basketball game.

## Healthy Eating
Contrary to popular belief, eating unhealthy foods when stressed will not help in reducing your overall stress levels. In reality, eating healthy foods on a regular basis and keeping a nutritious diet will help significantly more. According to WebMd, "A healthy diet can help counter the impact of stress by shoring up the immune system and lowering blood pressure" (WebMd, Diet for Stress Management). From my own experience I have found this to be true. I completed a 1 month paleo challenge with absolutely no cheat days and at the end I felt the most confident and clear minded as I ever had before. Was I missing delicious foods like burgers, pizza and ice cream? Absolutely. However, in the end it was 100% worth it. I've since fallen back into a regular diet eating whatever I want, but I do definitely limit myself to not eat unhealthy foods as often and even that has helped a lot in keeping a clear head. 

To help somebody who might not be sure where to start, I've provided a sample meal plan that will help fuel the body with a sufficient amount of cabrohydrates, fats, protein, and natural vitamins (Note: I've listed two options per meal):

<ul>
  <h4>Breakfast</h4>
  <li>Smoothie with Almond Butter Toast</li>
  <li>2 - 4 Eggs Scrambled with 1/2 Cup Plain Oatmeal (Cinnamon or PB2 to flavor)</li>
  <h4>Lunch</h4>
  <li>Spinach Salad with Hard Boiled Egg, Onions, Avocado, and Chicken (Light dressing to flavor)</li>
  <li>8oz Pork Chops, Broccoli, and Baked Sweet Potato</li>
  <h4>Dinner</h4>
  <li>8oz of Chicken with Brown rice and Green Peas or Asparagus</li>
  <li>Veggie Burger with 2 Eggs Over Easy and Buffalo Cauliflower</li>
  <h4>Snack</h4>
  <li>1 Cup Oatmeal</li>
  <li>Lightly Salted Almonds</li>
</ul>

## Sufficient Sleep
While eating healthy and working out will help tremendously in reducing stress, the ultimate key to managing stress is getting a sufficient amount of sleep each night. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), "Ninety percent of teens with low reported stress levels during the past school year say they get enough sleep, compared to less than half (48 percent) of teens with high reported stress levels during the past school year" (APA, Stress and Sleep). Sleeping allows the body to regenerate and repair muscle tissue. Without adequate sleep the body in unnable to repair and reset itself. See the below chart, provided by the National Sleep Foundation, for the recommended sleep times for individuals ages 18 - 25.

## Take Action
Science shows that regular exercise, a healthy diet, and sufficient sleep all help greatly in maintaining stress and being happy. To put this to the test, I challenge you to make a concious effort for one month to workout 3-4 times a week, maintain a healthy diet, and get 7-9 hours of sleep each night. 

I understand it can be difficult to measure stress and remember how you may have felt at a prior point in time, so using the <a href="https://das.nh.gov/wellness/docs/percieved%20stress%20scale.pdf">Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</a>, I created an online calculator to help determine stress levels in a person. To find your PSS rating, answer the following questions and click calculate. After finding your level of stress, write it down and come back in 30 days after making some positive changes to your lifestyle and see if your stress level result is any different.
